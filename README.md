# Task-Management
This project demonstrates a basic Task Management Web Application using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript, jQuery, and local storage. Users can add, change, delete and mark tasks as completed. Task data will persist on the page using the browsers localStorage API so that once added tasks will remain on the page even if you refresh the browser.
